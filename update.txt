## 3) Certificates section — updates
### A) Full-Stack Web Development Bootcamp
Update the description so it clearly reflects **frontend + backend**, not frontend only.

Use this description (or very close):

Completed a comprehensive full-stack program covering both front-end and back-end development. Built real-world applications using HTML5, CSS3, Flexbox, Grid, Bootstrap, and JavaScript (ES6), while also working across the full development lifecycle including application structure, data flow, and deployment-ready workflows.

Notes:
- Remove **“Jul–Dec”** completely (no dates shown).

### B) Learning Go (Golang)
Keep as-is unless already present.

Acceptance check:
- No dates shown under certificates.
- Full-stack certificate clearly mentions frontend **and** backend.

Ensure **programming languages and tools come first**, then place soft skills at the very end.
